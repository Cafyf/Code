## Overview

The User Progress Management System is a web application designed to enhance the experience of users on an online coding platform. Built using **Spring Boot**, this application provides a comprehensive solution for tracking user progress, executing code, and validating output results in real time.

## Key Features

### User Progress Management
- Tracks users’ coding activities, including completed exercises and challenges.
- Provides insights and analytics on user performance to help them identify strengths and areas for improvement.

### Code Execution
- Facilitates the execution of user-submitted code snippets in various programming languages.
- Utilizes isolated execution environments to ensure security and reliability.

### Output Validation
- Validates the output results of the executed code against expected outcomes.
- Provides immediate feedback to users, helping them understand errors and improve their coding skills.

### Spring Boot Framework
- Utilizes Spring Boot for its rapid development capabilities, ensuring a robust and maintainable application with minimal configuration.
- Implements a RESTful API to enable seamless communication between the front-end interface and back-end services.

### Docker Containerization
- The application is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistent deployment across various environments.
- Simplifies the setup and scalability of the application, making it easier to manage dependencies and configurations.

### Database Integration
- Integrates with [specify database, e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB] to manage user data, code submissions, and progress metrics effectively.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced User Experience**: By providing real-time feedback and progress tracking, users can improve their coding skills more effectively.
- **Portability**: The use of Docker allows for easy deployment and management of the application on any platform supporting Docker.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale easily, accommodating a growing number of users and code submissions.
- **Rapid Development**: Spring Boot’s features facilitate quick iterations and updates, allowing for continuous improvement based on user feedback.

## Conclusion
The User Progress Management System for the online coding platform represents a modern approach to enhancing the coding experience. By leveraging Spring Boot and Docker, the application offers a reliable, scalable, and user-friendly solution for managing coding challenges, executing code, and validating user submissions.
